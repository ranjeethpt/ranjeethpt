### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Engineering Manager with a background in Java, AWS and Node

My tech journey started as a full-stack Java engineer with Java, node, vanilla JavaScript , Angular & later React. Gradually, transitioned into Java backend development building Microservices, event driven pattern, API, integration etc.

As a manager, I still code, validate & challenge solutions, review PR, make crucial architectural decisions, and formulate effective strategies. 

My leadership philosophy centers on supporting my teammates' growth and career progression, helping them advance into roles such as Engineering Managers, Principal Engineers, or Team Leads. I believe in granting autonomy and fostering collaboration within the team. Transparent communication, encouraging all opinions, and making informed decisions are key principles I follow. I do say 'NO' and the reason behind it.

Technology and automation drive my passion, as I continuously seek to optimize processes and inspire innovation.

Beyond work, I'm passionate about travel (7 continents & 30 countries so far), meeting new people, and trying diverse cuisines. I enjoy playing soccer, cricket, do ocean swims & a bit of Muay thai. 

I'm currently learning to surf, which is more challenging than I expected. Despite my fair share of falls (around 1 hour and 45 minutes' worth!), I did manage to capture a cool photo of the experience during my trip to Hawaii.
