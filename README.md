### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Engineering Manager with a background in Java, AWS and Node

My tech journey started as a full-stack Java engineer with Java, node, vanilla JavaScript , Angular & later React. Gradually, transitioned into Java backend development building Microservices, event driven pattern, API, integration etc.

As a manager, I still code, validate & challenge solutions, review PR, make crucial architectural decisions, and formulate effective strategies. 

My leadership philosophy revolves around granting autonomy and fostering collaboration within the team. I believe in transparent communication, encouraging all opinions, and making informed decisions. I do say 'NO' and the reason behind it. 

Technology and automation drive my passion, as I continuously seek to optimize processes and inspire innovation.

Beyond work, I'm passionate about travel (21 countries so far), meeting new people, and trying diverse cuisines. I enjoy playing soccer, cricket, do ocean swims & a bit of Muay thai. 

I'm currently learning to surf, which is more challenging than I expected. Despite my fair share of falls (around 1 hour and 45 minutes' worth!), I did manage to capture a cool photo of the experience during my trip to Hawaii.
